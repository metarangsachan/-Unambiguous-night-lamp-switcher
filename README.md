# Unambiguous-night-lamp-switcher
Night light control system needs no manual operation for switching ON and OFF when there is need of light. It detects itself whether there is need for light or not. When darkness rises to a certain value then automatically light is switched ON and when there is other source of light i.e. day time, the light gets OFF.

Usage of LEDs is growing day by day due to the advantages they provide compared to the conventional filament bulbs or fluorescent lamps. They provide good quality of white light with a better intensity compared to others. They also consume less power compared to their alternatives.

This automatic night light system may also be appropriately used to control building porch lights, neon signs, large advertising displays, gallery lights and also as automatic house interior decorative lights. Thus this simple inexpensive circuit should not only be able to relieve you from the headache of timely switching the particular lights but also will result in quite an economical way of using them.
